Unlike traditional map searches, [this application](https://scoutaround-254808934590.us-west1.run.app/) uses **Google Gemini** to:
1.  **Understand "Vibe"**: It analyzes reviews and descriptions to score places based on dynamic criteria (e.g., "Coziness" for cafes, "Serenity" for parks).
2.  **Smart Filter**: It finds places that match specific interests like "Espresso", "Activities for girl scouts", or "Outdoor places for running".

-   **Dynamic Vibe Meter**: A visual rating system that adapts to your query.
-   **Smart Grounding**: Uses Google Maps and Google Search tools to provide real-world data, addresses, and operating status.
-   **30km Radius**: Finds hidden gems outside the immediate city center.
